# SRPG
An experiment in both 3D game making and the Unity editor. The project goal is a small-scale parody of the traditional JRPG formula by setting the game in Scandinavia with Swedish voice acting. 

### Scope
* Small town and close by wilderness.
* Third person movement.
* Dialogue, voice acting and basic cutscenes
